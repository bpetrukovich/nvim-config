INTRODUCTION                                                  *kickstart.nvim*

Kickstart.nvim is a project to help you get started on your neovim journey.

                                                            *kickstart-is-not*
It is not:
- Complete framework for every plugin under the sun
- Place to add every plugin that could ever be useful

                                                                *kickstart-is*
It is:
- Somewhere that has a good start for the most common "IDE" type features:
    - autocompletion
    - goto-definition
    - find references
    - fuzzy finding
    - and hinting at what more can be done :)
- A place to _kickstart_ your journey.
    - You should fork this project and use/modify it so that it matches your
      style and preferences. If you don't want to do that, there are probably
      other projects that would fit much better for you (and that's great!)!

-- [[ Configure and install plugins ]]
--
--  To check the current status of your plugins, run
--    :Lazy
--
--  You can press `?` in this menu for help. Use `:q` to close the window
--
--  To update plugins you can run
--    :Lazy update
--
-- Use `opts = {}` to automatically pass options to a plugin's `setup()` function, forcing the plugin to be loaded.
-- Alternatively, use `config = function() ... end` for full control over the configuration.
-- If you prefer to call `setup` explicitly, use:
--    {
--        'lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim',
--        config = function()
--            require('gitsigns').setup({
--                -- Your gitsigns configuration here
--            })
--        end,
--    }
--
-- NOTE: Plugins can also be configured to run Lua code when they are loaded.
--
-- This is often very useful to both group configuration, as well as handle
-- lazy loading plugins that don't need to be loaded immediately at startup.
--
-- For example, in the following configuration, we use:
--  event = 'VimEnter'
--
-- which loads which-key before all the UI elements are loaded. Events can be
-- normal autocommands events (`:help autocmd-events`).
-- For additional information with loading, sourcing and examples see `:help lazy.nvim-ðŸ”Œ-plugin-spec`
-- Or use telescope!
-- In normal mode type `<space>sh` then write `lazy.nvim-plugin`
-- you can continue same window with `<space>sr` which resumes last telescope search
